					<h2>Our Project</h2>
					<p>The project raises awareness of generational trauma and its effects in the Philippines, educates and trains those affected, and promotes healing and resilience through research-backed therapies and interventions. The project team will start with community outreach and education, including seminars, workshops, and other educational events, to raise awareness of generational trauma and its repercussions. The project also seeks to establish peer support networks, community-based support programs, and online support resources for generational trauma survivors. The project's expected outcomes include increased awareness of generational trauma and its effects in the Philippines, improved access to education and training for those affected, increased use of evidence-based interventions and therapies to promote healing and resilience, the creation of a support network for those affected, and improved mental and physical health.</p>
